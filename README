JiftyX-ModelHelprs

This is my work to make C<Jifty::DBI> objects a little bit easier to
start with. It let you write something this obvious:

  $book = Book(42);
  $books = BookCollection( author => "Neal Stephenson" );

This module is released as an extension under JiftyX namespace as
requested by jifty team. Use it at your own risk.

Cheers,
